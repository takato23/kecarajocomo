## Issues Found

### Minor Issues:
1. **Style Prop Warning**: The GlassCard component receives a `style` prop that it doesn't accept. This should be addressed by either:
   - Adding style prop to GlassCard interface
   - Using className for the shadow effect

2. **Range Slider Styling**: The custom slider styling uses inline styles which could be moved to CSS modules or styled-components for better maintainability.

### Accessibility Considerations:
1. **Keyboard Navigation**: While functional, could benefit from:
   - Focus indicators on interactive elements
   - Arrow key navigation between options
   - Enter/Space key selection

2. **Screen Reader Support**: Could be enhanced with:
   - aria-labels for icon-only elements
   - aria-selected for selection states
   - Role attributes for custom components

## Recommendations

### High Priority:
1. Fix the style prop type issue on GlassCard component
2. Add proper TypeScript types for all props
3. Add keyboard navigation support

### Medium Priority:
1. Add loading states for async operations
2. Add error boundaries for graceful error handling
3. Enhance accessibility attributes

### Low Priority:
1. Extract inline styles to styled components
2. Add unit tests for edge cases
3. Consider memoization for performance optimization

## Overall Assessment

**Score: 9/10**

The MealPlannerWizard component is well-implemented with excellent visual design and smooth user experience. The glass-morphism effects are beautifully executed, animations are smooth, and the multi-step flow is intuitive. The component properly manages state and communicates with parent components through callbacks.

The minor issues identified are mostly related to code organization and accessibility enhancements rather than functional problems. The component is production-ready with these minor improvements.
