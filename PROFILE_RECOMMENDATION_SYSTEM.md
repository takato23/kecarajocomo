# Intelligent Profile Recommendation System

## Overview

An AI-powered profile recommendation system that provides personalized suggestions based on user behavior, profile completeness, and preferences. The system adapts to user needs and provides intelligent questionnaires to improve the meal planning experience.

## Components Created

### 1. ProfileRecommendationEngine (`src/services/profile/ProfileRecommendationEngine.ts`)

**Core AI Engine** that analyzes user profiles and generates intelligent recommendations.

**Key Features:**
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI-powered recommendations with confidence scoring
- **Adaptive Questionnaires**: Dynamic question generation based on profile gaps
- **Nutritional Goal Suggestions**: Personalized nutrition recommendations
- **Budget Optimization**: Cost-effective meal planning strategies
- **Ingredient Learning**: Learns from user behavior and preferences
- **Recipe Recommendations**: Personalized recipe suggestions
- **Behavior Pattern Analysis**: Tracks and analyzes user activity patterns

**Core Classes:**
- `ProfileRecommendationEngine`: Main recommendation engine
- `SmartSuggestion`: Recommendation data structure
- `QuestionnaireQuestion`: Adaptive question structure
- `RecommendationContext`: User context for recommendations

### 2. useProfileRecommendations Hook (`src/hooks/useProfileRecommendations.ts`)

**React Hook** that provides easy access to the recommendation system.

**Features:**
- **Real-time Recommendations**: Auto-refreshing suggestions

- Range sliders
- Number inputs
- Text inputs
- Yes/No questions

### 4. ProfileSuggestions Component (`src/components/profile/recommendations/ProfileSuggestions.tsx`)

**Main UI Component** for displaying AI-powered recommendations.

**Features:**
- **Categorized Suggestions**: Organized by dietary, budget, cooking, etc.
- **Priority Highlighting**: High-priority suggestions prominently displayed
- **Profile Completion Overview**: Shows completion percentage and gaps
- **Expandable Details**: Detailed information for each suggestion
- **Action Management**: Apply or dismiss suggestions
- **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refresh capabilities
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes

**Recommendation Categories:**
- Profile Completion
- Dietary Preferences
- Budget Optimization
- Cooking Skills
- Meal Planning
- Behavioral Patterns

## Integration Points

### Profile Context Integration
- Seamlessly integrates with existing `ProfileContext`
- Uses `useProfileData`, `useProfileActions`, and `useProfileComputed`
- Auto-saves questionnaire responses to user profile

### Type System Integration
- Leverages existing profile types from `@/types/profile`
- Compatible with `UserProfile`, `UserPreferences`, and related types
- Extends type system with recommendation-specific interfaces

### UI Component Integration
- Uses project's existing UI component library
- Consistent with design system and theming
- Responsive and accessible design patterns

## AI Recommendation Logic

### Recommendation Scoring
Each suggestion includes:
- **Confidence Score** (0-100): How certain the AI is about the recommendation
- **Relevance Score** (0-100): How relevant to the user's current needs
- **Priority Level**: Critical, High, Medium, Low

### Profile Gap Analysis
Identifies missing information:
- Essential fields (dietary restrictions, allergies, budget)
- Impact assessment (high, medium, low)
- Completion improvement potential

### Behavior Pattern Learning
Tracks user interactions:
- Ingredient preferences (like, dislike, neutral)
- Recipe selections and cooking frequency
- Activity patterns and trends
- Seasonal and temporal factors

### Adaptive Questionnaire Logic
Generates questions based on:
- Missing profile information
- Impact potential of each field
- User's current cooking skill level
- Household composition and constraints

## Usage Examples

### Basic Implementation

```tsx
import { ProfileSuggestions } from '@/components/profile/recommendations/ProfileSuggestions';
import { SmartQuestionnaire } from '@/components/profile/recommendations/SmartQuestionnaire';
import { useProfileRecommendations } from '@/hooks/useProfileRecommendations';

function ProfileRecommendationsPage() {
  const {
    suggestions,
    questionnaire,
    isLoading,
    refreshRecommendations,
    applySuggestion,
    dismissSuggestion
  } = useProfileRecommendations({
    includeRecipes: true,
    includeBudgetOptimization: true,
    includeNutritionalGoals: true,
    autoRefresh: true
  });

  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      {/* Main recommendations display */}
      <ProfileSuggestions 
        showCategories={true}
        maxSuggestions={10}
        autoRefresh={true}
      />
      
      {/* Smart questionnaire for profile completion */}
      {questionnaire.length > 0 && (
        <SmartQuestionnaire 
          questions={questionnaire}
          onComplete={(answers) => {
            console.log('Questionnaire completed:', answers);
            refreshRecommendations();
          }}
          autoSave={true}
          showProgress={true}
        />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Advanced Usage with Behavior Tracking

```tsx
function MealPlanningPage() {
  const {
    updateBehaviorPattern,
    trackIngredientInteraction,
    getHighPriorityRecommendations
  } = useProfileRecommendations();

  const handleRecipeView = (recipe: Recipe) => {
    // Track user behavior
    updateBehaviorPattern({
      pattern: 'recipe_viewing',
      frequency: 1,
      lastOccurrence: new Date(),
      trend: 'increasing',
      impact: 'positive'
    });
  };

  const handleIngredientSelection = (ingredient: string, liked: boolean) => {
    // Track ingredient preferences
    trackIngredientInteraction(
      ingredient, 
      liked ? 'liked' : 'disliked'
    );
  };

  // Get urgent recommendations
  const urgentSuggestions = getHighPriorityRecommendations();

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your meal planning interface */}
      {urgentSuggestions.length > 0 && (
        <div className="mb-4 p-4 bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded-lg">
          <h3 className="font-semibold text-red-800">Urgent Recommendations</h3>
          {urgentSuggestions.map(suggestion => (
            <div key={suggestion.id} className="mt-2">
              <strong>{suggestion.title}</strong>: {suggestion.description}
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```
