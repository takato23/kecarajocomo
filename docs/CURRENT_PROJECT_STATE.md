## Code Quality & Testing

### Current Status
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled
- **Linting**: ESLint configured with Next.js rules
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright
- **Component Testing**: Some components have tests
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright tests for critical paths

### Code Coverage
- Unit Tests: ~30% coverage
- Integration Tests: Basic API testing
- E2E Tests: Critical user flows covered

## Performance Metrics

### Current Performance
- **Lighthouse Score**: ~85 (Desktop), ~75 (Mobile)
- **Core Web Vitals**:
  - LCP: ~2.8s
  - FID: ~95ms
  - CLS: ~0.08
- **Bundle Size**: ~450KB initial load

### Optimization Opportunities
1. Image optimization with Next.js Image component
2. Code splitting for feature modules
3. Lazy loading for heavy components
4. API response caching

## Database Schema Status

- **Core Tables**: Implemented via Supabase
  - users, profiles, recipes, meal_plans
  - pantry_items, shopping_lists
- **Relationships**: Properly configured with foreign keys
- **RLS Policies**: Basic policies in place
- **Migrations**: Manual migration approach

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### High Priority
1. Multiple meal planner implementations need consolidation
2. State management inconsistency (stores vs. contexts)
3. Missing error boundaries in some components
4. Incomplete TypeScript coverage in older components

### Medium Priority
1. Component duplication in some features
2. Inconsistent naming conventions
3. Missing loading states in some views
4. API error handling needs improvement

### Low Priority
1. Storybook stories outdated
2. Documentation needs updates
3. Some unused dependencies
4. CSS class organization

## Security Status

- **Authentication**: Secure with Supabase Auth
- **API Keys**: Environment variables properly configured
- **RLS**: Basic Row Level Security implemented
- **CORS**: Properly configured
- **Data Validation**: Input validation on critical endpoints

## Deployment Readiness

### âœ… Ready
- Vercel deployment configuration
- Environment variable setup
- Build process optimized
- Static asset optimization

### ðŸš§ Needs Work
- Database migration strategy
- CI/CD pipeline completion
- Monitoring and error tracking
- Performance monitoring

## Development Workflow

### Current Process
1. Feature branches from main
2. Local development with hot reload
3. Manual testing before commits
4. Direct deployment to Vercel

### Recommended Improvements
1. Implement PR review process
2. Add automated testing in CI
3. Set up staging environment
4. Implement feature flags

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Week 1-2)
1. Consolidate meal planner implementations
2. Complete AI integration for meal generation
3. Fix high-priority bugs
4. Improve error handling

### Short Term (Month 1)
1. Complete pantry intelligence features
2. Implement price tracking
3. Enhance mobile experience
4. Add comprehensive testing

### Medium Term (Month 2-3)
1. Launch beta version
2. Implement user feedback
3. Add social features
4. Performance optimization

## Team Notes

- **Design System**: iOS26-inspired glass morphism is partially implemented
- **AI Integration**: Both Claude and Gemini are configured but need optimization
- **Mobile First**: Responsive design implemented but needs refinement
- **Accessibility**: Basic a11y implemented, needs comprehensive audit

## Conclusion

KeCarajoComer is in a solid development state with core features implemented and a clear path forward. The architecture is scalable and the codebase is maintainable, though some consolidation and cleanup work is needed. The project is approximately 60% complete towards MVP launch.
