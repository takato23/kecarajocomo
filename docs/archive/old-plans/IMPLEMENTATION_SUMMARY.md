# Implementation Summary - Phase 2: Pantry Management System

## üéØ What We've Completed

### ‚úÖ Database Schema Extended
- **New Tables Added:**
  - `stores` - Store information (Disco, Jumbo, Carrefour, etc.)
  - `products` - Product catalog with normalization
  - `price_history` - Price tracking across stores
  - `pantry_items_extended` - Extended pantry item information
  - `scanned_receipts` - Receipt scanning data
- **Enhanced Relations:** Connected pantry items to products and price history
- **Migration:** Successfully applied to Supabase PostgreSQL

### ‚úÖ Core Services Implemented
1. **Parser Utilities** (`/src/lib/parser/parserUtils.ts`)
   - Ingredient name normalization
   - Unit standardization
   - Product categorization
   - Price parsing for Argentine format
   - Brand extraction from product names

2. **Store Scraping Service** (`/src/lib/services/storeScraper.ts`)
   - Integration with BuscaPrecios API
   - Intelligent caching (15-minute TTL)
   - Product search normalization
   - Mock data fallback for development
   - Batch processing capabilities

3. **Price Tracking Service** (`/src/lib/services/priceTracker.ts`)
   - Price history management
   - Trend analysis (up/down/stable)
   - Store comparison
   - Lowest price detection
   - Batch price updates

4. **Cache Service** (`/src/lib/services/cacheService.ts`)
   - Multi-level caching (Memory + IndexedDB)
   - TTL-based expiration
   - LRU eviction
   - Performance statistics
   - Browser-compatible implementation

### ‚úÖ Pantry Management UI
1. **Pantry Dashboard** (`/src/app/pantry/page.tsx`)
   - Real-time statistics (total items, expiring soon, low stock)
   - Visual item cards with status indicators
   - Expiry date color coding
   - Location-based organization
   - Responsive grid layout

2. **Add Item Form** (`/src/app/pantry/add/page.tsx`)
   - Comprehensive item entry form
   - Location selection (pantry, fridge, freezer)
   - Date management (purchase/expiry)
   - Price tracking integration
   - Notes and additional info
   - Placeholder for scanning features

3. **API Endpoints** (`/src/app/api/pantry/route.ts`)
   - CRUD operations for pantry items
   - Ingredient deduplication
   - Extended info management
   - Filtering and search capabilities
   - Proper error handling

### ‚úÖ Dependencies & Environment
- **New Libraries Installed:**
  - `@zxing/library` - Barcode scanning
  - `@google/generative-ai` - AI image analysis
  - `zustand` - State management
  - `decimal.js` - Precise decimal calculations
  - `class-variance-authority` - UI variants
- **Environment Variables:** Added BuscaPrecios API configuration
- **TypeScript:** Full type safety throughout

## üöß Next Implementation Steps

### 1. Barcode Scanner (Priority: High)
- Create scanner component with camera access
- Integrate @zxing/library for barcode decoding
- Connect to product database
- Add to pantry item form

### 2. Receipt OCR Scanner (Priority: High)
- Implement Gemini AI integration
- Create image preprocessing pipeline
- Build receipt parsing logic
- Batch add items from receipt

### 3. Shopping List with Prices (Priority: High)
- Enhance shopping list with real-time prices
- Store comparison features
- Auto-generation from low stock items
- Price optimization recommendations

### 4. Advanced Features (Priority: Medium)
- Edit/delete pantry items
- Usage tracking and analytics
- Expiration notifications
- Shopping list optimization
