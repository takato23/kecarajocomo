# Profile Management Implementation Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive profile management system has been implemented that integrates holistically with the entire KeCarajoComer application. The system serves as the central hub for user data, preferences, and personalization across all features.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ProfileContext (`src/contexts/ProfileContext.tsx`)
- **Global state management** for profile data
- **Methods for profile operations**: update profile, update preferences, upload avatar
- **Household member management**: add, update, remove members
- **Helper methods**: getDietaryRestrictions(), getAllergies(), getHouseholdSize(), getBudget()
- **Integration helpers**: getPersonalizationData(), getRecommendationProfile(), getPlanningConstraints()
- **Sync and cache management**

### 2. Enhanced Data Models (`src/types/profile.ts`)
- **UserProfile**: Extended with stats, privacy settings, theme, language
- **UserPreferences**: Comprehensive preferences including cooking, planning, shopping, notifications
- **HouseholdMember**: Support for multiple household members with individual preferences
- **Supporting types**: DietaryRestriction, Allergy, MealSchedule, etc.

### 3. Database Schema (`supabase/migrations/20240115_profile_enhancements.sql`)
- Enhanced user_profiles table with new columns
- Added household_members table
- Proper indexes and RLS policies
- Automatic timestamp updates

### 4. Profile UI Components

#### ProfileHub (`src/components/profile/ProfileHub.tsx`)
- Main profile management interface
- Tabbed navigation for different sections
- Profile completion tracking
- Quick stats overview

#### ProfileHeader (`src/components/profile/ProfileHeader.tsx`)
- Avatar management with upload
- Profile editing
- Achievement badges
- Completion progress

#### ProfileOverview (`src/components/profile/ProfileOverview.tsx`)
- Activity statistics
- Profile summary
- Nutrition goals
- Cuisine preferences

#### DietaryPreferences (`src/components/profile/DietaryPreferences.tsx`)
- Dietary restrictions management
- Allergy tracking
- Household-wide summary
- Cuisine preferences
- Nutrition goals

#### HouseholdManager (`src/components/profile/HouseholdManager.tsx`)
- Add/edit/remove household members
- Individual member preferences
- Dietary restrictions per member
- Relationship tracking

#### CookingPreferences (`src/components/profile/CookingPreferences.tsx`)
- Skill level setting
- Time availability (weekday/weekend)
- Cooking methods preferences
- Kitchen tools inventory
- Planning preferences
- Budget management

#### ProfileSettings (`src/components/profile/ProfileSettings.tsx`)
- Theme selection (light/dark/system)
- Language preferences
- Notification settings
- Privacy controls

#### MiniProfileWidget (`src/components/profile/MiniProfileWidget.tsx`)
- Compact profile display for use throughout the app
- Shows key constraints (household size, restrictions, budget)
- Quick access to full profile

### 5. API Routes
- **`/api/profile/complete`**: Fetch complete profile with all related data
- **`/api/profile/avatar`**: Avatar upload endpoint
- **`/api/profile/household`**: CRUD operations for household members

### 6. Integration Features

#### MealPlannerStore Integration (`src/features/planner/hooks/useProfileIntegration.ts`)
- Automatic sync of profile preferences to meal planner
- Profile-based recipe filtering
- Personalized meal plan generation
- Budget and time constraint enforcement

#### MealPlannerWithProfile Component (`src/features/planner/components/MealPlannerWithProfile.tsx`)
- Wrapper component showing profile constraints
- Allergy warnings
- Budget tracking
- Recipe compatibility checking

### 7. App Integration
- ProfileProvider added to app layout
- Profile page created at `/profile`
- Navigation already configured with profile links

## Key Features

### 1. Holistic Integration
- Single source of truth for user preferences
- Automatic propagation of constraints to all features
- Consistent user experience across the app

### 2. Household Management
- Support for multiple household members
- Individual dietary restrictions and allergies
- Combined constraint enforcement

### 3. Smart Personalization
- Recipe filtering based on all constraints
- Meal plan generation considering preferences
- Shopping list optimization
- Pantry management based on household size

### 4. Privacy & Control
- Granular privacy settings
- Profile visibility controls
- Data sharing preferences

### 5. Performance
- Efficient caching strategies
- Optimistic updates
- Lazy loading of detailed data

## Usage Examples

### In Components
```typescript
import { useProfile } from '@/contexts/ProfileContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { 
    profile, 
    preferences,
    getDietaryRestrictions,
    updatePreferences 
  } = useProfile();
  
  // Use profile data
}
```

### In Meal Planning
```typescript
import { useProfileIntegration } from '@/features/planner/hooks/useProfileIntegration';

function MealPlanner() {
  const { 
    planningConstraints,
    dietaryRestrictions 
  } = useProfileIntegration();
  
  // Automatically filtered recipes
}
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Run database migrations to create new tables
2. Update existing user data to include new fields
3. Test profile creation and editing flows
4. Verify integration with meal planner

### Future Enhancements
1. Social features (following/followers)
2. Recipe sharing based on privacy settings
3. Household meal preference learning
4. Advanced analytics dashboard
5. Export/import profile data
6. Multiple profile support

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Users
1. Database migration will add new columns with defaults
2. Users will be prompted to complete profile on next login
3. Existing preferences will be preserved
4. New features gracefully degrade if not configured

### For Developers
1. Use ProfileContext instead of direct store access
2. Always check for profile data availability
3. Use helper methods for common operations
4. Follow the established patterns for new features

This implementation provides a solid foundation for personalization throughout the KeCarajoComer application, ensuring that every feature can leverage user preferences intelligently while maintaining performance and privacy.
